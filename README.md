# while
---------The while loop loops through a block of code as long as a specified condition is True:

# syntax
  
  while (condition) 
  {
  // code block to be executed
  }
  
  # Example on while loop
  
  int i = 0;
  while (i < 5) 
 {
  Console.WriteLine(i);              //output: 1 2 3 4
  i++;
  }
  
  # do while
  --------This loop will execute the code block once, before checking if the condition is true, then it will repeat the loop as long as the condition is true.
 
 
 # syntax
  do 
 {
  // code block to be executed
 }
 while (condition);
 
 # Example on do while
 
 int i = 0;
 do 
{
  Console.WriteLine(i);                      //output : 1 2 3 4
  i++;
}
while (i < 5);
